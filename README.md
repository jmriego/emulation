# How to use Launchbox2AEL

- Install Python
- Clone this repo or download it as a zip and unzip it somewhere
- Make sure you have accessed AEL plugin at least once
- Copy the config.ini.example into config.ini and modify it:
  * You need to tell it where AEL plugin is installed. It's probably one of the two options already in the config. Leave only one line uncommented
  * Tell it where Launchbox is installed
  * dosbox exe and args are the command line for running DOSBOX games
- You need to install the lxml library: *pip install lxml*
- Run or double click Launchbox2AEL.py every time you want to export changes in your Launchbox library to AEL
